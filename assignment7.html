    <h1>RBI raises rates to tame inflation</h1>
    <p>The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday voted unanimously to increase
        the repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.90% in a bid to slow inflation that it estimates will average 7.5% in the
        current April-June quarter.The MPC also decided to remain focused on the withdrawal of accommodation which had
        been provided to support the COVID-19 hit economy, to ensure that inflation remains within the target going
        forward, while supporting growth, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said while announcing the rate increase.</p>

    <p>“Inflation has steeply increased much beyond the upper tolerance level,. A large part of the rise in inflation is
        primarily attributed to a series of supply shocks linked to the war [in Ukraine]. In these circumstances, we
        have started a gradual and orderly withdrawal of extraordinary accommodation instituted during the pandemic,”
        Mr. Das explained.Based on the assumption of a normal monsoon in 2022, and average crude oil price (Indian
        basket) of $105 per barrel, inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was now projected by the RBI at
        6.7% in 2022-23, with Q1 at 7.5%; Q2 at 7.4%; Q3 at 6.2%; and Q4 at 5.8%, with risks evenly balanced.

        About 75% of the increase in inflation projections could be attributed to the food group, Mr. Das said,
        observing that “the recent spike in tomato prices” were adding to food inflation. Also, the baseline inflation
        projection of 6.7% for 2022-23 did not take into account the impact of monetary policy actions taken on
        Wednesday, he added.</p> <br>
